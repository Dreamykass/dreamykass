# Hello, it's me, Dreamykass.
I like space, worldbuilding, science fiction, futurology, and, of course, programming! I'm currently studying computer science / informatics.


Technologies that I like and, I like to think, I am familiar with:
- **Rust!** - I'm currently making a game in Rust (wgpu, rapier, hecs) for my diploma project, 
  but also did experiment with Rocket a bit, and did a part of the 2020 Advent Of Code in Rust, as means of discovering the language (and falling in love with it).
- C++ - Specifically, modern-ish C++. I used to experiment with various libraries, 
  like SFML, Asio, ZeroMQ; as well as with pure C++ features like template metaprogramming.
- C# - ASP.NET, Razor Pages. C# is pretty cool I think, I really need to find more excuses to use it.



# Projects:
That I am proud of:
- [spectrometry-devsite](https://dreamykass.github.io/spectrometry-devsite/) - Website for my game that I am working on for my diploma project (which itself can't be made public, unfortunately). The site is just a simple, static one, but it describes the game, the tools used, goals, and planned features.
- [backpropagation-csharp](https://github.com/Dreamykass/backpropagation-csharp) - Backpropagation neural network implemented in C#, in an easy-to-understand OOP-way.
- [bitsofkass](https://github.com/Dreamykass/bitsofkass) - A bunch of bits and pieces and little projects and examples, of things I experimented with or worked on, in various languages, libraries, and technologies. Mostly C++ stuff.

Web stuff:
- [webapp-shop-catalogue](https://github.com/Dreamykass/webapp-shop-catalogue) - A tiny and simple single-page catalogue of albums for a music shop. JS/AJAX front, Rust/Rocket backend. University assignment.
- [webchat-go-js](https://github.com/Dreamykass/webchat-go-js) - Simple discord/slack like chat, single-page webapp. JS/React front, Golang backend. Not yet finished.
- [website-quiz-laravel](https://github.com/Dreamykass/website-quiz-laravel) - Small and simple quiz/exam website, made in Laravel/PHP. University assignment.

Other:
- [is_even](https://github.com/Dreamykass/is_even) - Enterprise-grade C++ library that provides a function that calculates whether a number is even.
- [wgpu-tiny-graphics](https://github.com/Dreamykass/wgpu-tiny-graphics) - A tiny example/exploration on how to write graphics in Rust, with wgpu. Not yet finished, put on the backburner in favor of working on my game.
- [maizefunge](https://github.com/Dreamykass/maizefunge) - Befunge superset, esoteric language, interpreter written in rust. Not yet finished.
- [advent-of-code](https://github.com/Dreamykass/advent-of-code) - My solutions to the Advent Of Code programming puzzles.
- [random-uni-work](https://github.com/Dreamykass/random-uni-work) - Various university assignments, too small to put on their own repos.
