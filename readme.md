# Hello, I'm Dreamykass.
I like space, worldbuilding, science fiction, futurology, and, of course, programming! I'm currently studying informatics/comp-sci.

See my GitHub page here: <https://dreamykass.github.io/> for my projects, a longer about-me section, blog, etc.

I'm also working on a game written in Rust, for my diploma project. See more about about it here: <https://dreamykass.github.io/spectrometry-devsite/>


Technologies that I like and, I like to think, I am familiar with:
- **Rust!**
- C++
- C#
